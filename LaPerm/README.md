Description: LaPerms are gentle and affectionate but also very active. Unlike many active breeds, the LaPerm is also quite content to be a lap cat. The LaPerm will often follow your lead; that is, if they are busy playing and you decide to sit and relax, simply pick up your LaPerm and sit down with it, and it will stay in your lap, devouring the attention you give it.
